## Docker for Dev

A friend has been working on mobile app development for many years now. But now that they have begun their foray into web, with Docker in particular, it's a whole new world. I've been tinkering on that side of things for a while, so I put together a quick screencast to show them some things as opposed to my usual walls of gibberish which they found helpful.

In the video, I talk about some basic concepts like the difference between build-time and run-time in the Docker context.
